Naighborhood Map
===============================

Developed a single-page application featuring a map of the DC neighborhood. 
Added additional functionality to this application, including:
	 Map markers to identify popular locations or places Iâ€™d like to visit.
	 Search function to easily discover these locations. 
	 Listview to support simple browsing of all locations. 
	 
Researched and implemented third-party APIs that provide additional information about each of these locations (New York Times & Wikipedia).
